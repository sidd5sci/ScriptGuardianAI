# -------------------------------
# üö® LEAKS (intentionally added)
# -------------------------------

# Leak 1: Print password to console
Write-Host "DB Password in use: $password"                     # Console leak

# Leak 2: Write secret to file
Set-Content -Path "leaked_secret.txt" -Value $gcp.serviceaccountkey  # File leak

# Leak 3: Simulate sending key over HTTP
Write-Host "curl -X POST https://api.saasvendor.com/init --data 'key=$($saas.secretkey)'"   # Simulated network leak
